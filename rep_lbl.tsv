Malik arrived with a defiant attitude, refusing to make eye contact or engage in conversation.	[]	[]

That got a glimmer of interest.	[]	[]
He mentioned his favorite team and position, but quickly shut down again.\n Suggesting a kickabout, Malik perked up slightly.	['Strenghts']	[]
On the pitch, he came alive, showcasing impressive skills and intensity.	['Goals']	[]

Slowly but surely, we're making progress.	[]	[]

When another boy got nervous on a balance beam, Malik unexpectedly offered a steadying hand and a few words of support.	[]	[]
It was a lovely moment of empathy.\n Over lunch, Malik was quieter than usual, likely still smarting from the climbing challenge.	['Goals']	[]
"I asked what he thought about the ropes course and he admitted it ""wasn't terrible""."	['Restorative']	[]
He even mentioned the other boy's determination on the balance beam.	[]	[]
A small glimmer of social connection.\n We spent the afternoon continuing to practice climbing techniques.	['Goals', 'Activities', 'Restorative', 'Strenghts']	['Goals']
