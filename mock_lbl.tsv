Malik arrived with a defiant attitude, refusing to make eye contact or engage in conversation. He slouched in his chair, arms crossed, muttering that this was a waste of time.\n I gave Malik space while casually chatting about football. That got a glimmer of interest. He mentioned his favorite team and position, but quickly shut down again.\n Suggesting a kickabout, Malik perked up slightly. On the pitch, he came alive, showcasing impressive skills and intensity. However, when I played defense, Malik got easily frustrated and lashed out verbally.\n During lunch, Malik sat alone, scrolling his phone. Attempts to engage him were met with grunts and shrugs. He wolfed down his food and immediately asked to go for a smoke, which I had to deny.\n In the afternoon, I introduced Malik to the bike maintenance station, thinking the hands-on task might appeal to him. He was initially dismissive but eventually got stuck in. Showing him how to change a tire, Malik paid close attention and then did the next one himself.\n As the day ended, Malik's mood seemed to have lifted a bit. I praised his football skills and focus during the bike task. He just nodded, but it felt like a small step in the right direction. Building trust will be crucial moving forward.
Grey skies and a persistent drizzle set a gloomy tone as Malik arrived, hood up and headphones in. He brushed past me without a word and slumped into a chair.\n Sensing Malik's dark mood, I suggested an indoor football drill session. He resisted at first, but eventually joined in. Despite the confined space, Malik went full throttle, playing aggressively. When he missed a shot, he punched the wall in frustration.\n We paused for a cooldown and I gently probed what was bothering him. Malik shut me down, saying everything was stupid. I acknowledged his feelings without judgment and offered some deep breathing exercises. Malik scoffed but begrudgingly participated.\n At lunch, Malik was sullen and sarcastic. He complained about the food, the weather, the program - everything. I listened patiently and validated his complaints where appropriate, while also encouraging him to redirect his energy. In the afternoon, I set up a circuit training session, thinking the variety might help Malik stay engaged. He initially put in minimal effort, but with encouragement, he began to apply himself. Malik even cracked a smile during a particularly challenging set of burpees.\n Wrapping up, I noticed Malik's knuckles were bruised from punching the wall. We talked about healthier ways to release anger, like exercise or deep breathing. Malik was skeptical but agreed to try counting to ten next time he felt overwhelmed. A small victory on a challenging day.\n
Autumn leaves crunched underfoot as Malik arrived, football in hand. He was more talkative than usual, excited about his team's weekend win. I seized on his good mood and suggested some football drills.\n On the pitch, Malik's skills were on full display. His footwork and ball control were excellent. I praised his technique and he flashed a genuine smile. However, when I gave constructive feedback on his teamwork, Malik's demeanor shifted. He argued it wasn't his fault others weren't up to his level.\n We took a water break and I gently pointed out that even top players rely on their teammates. Malik was quiet, processing. He then admitted he sometimes struggles to control his temper on the pitch, which gets him benched. It was a moment of valuable self-reflection.\n Over lunch, Malik was more engaged, eagerly discussing football stats and highlights. I noticed he got frustrated trying to calculate a percentage and discreetly offered assistance. Malik accepted, a big step for him.\n In the afternoon, we ran passing drills. When Malik misplaced a pass, I could see his anger rising. I called for a quick timeout and reminded him to breathe. To my surprise, Malik actually paused and took a few deep breaths. He was able to reset and continue calmly.\n As we ended the day, I commended Malik on his self-awareness and efforts to control his temper. He shrugged it off, but I could tell he was pleased. Malik left saying he might teach me a few moves next time. Slowly but surely, we're making progress.
Cold wind whipped through the trees as Malik arrived, hands jammed in his pockets. I suggested trying climbing to start the day, hoping to capitalize on his physical energy and challenge him with something new.\n At the climbing wall, Malik was clearly out of his comfort zone. He struggled with the harness and grunted in frustration as he slipped off the holds. Halfway up, he got stuck and started cursing under his breath. I called up encouragement, reminding him to breathe and take his time.\n After several failed attempts, Malik came down defeated and angry. He ripped off the harness, shouting that climbing was stupid and stomped off. I gave him some space before approaching. We talked about how trying new things can be tough and it's okay to struggle. Malik was resistant but eventually rejoined the group.\n For a team-building exercise before lunch, the group worked together to navigate a low ropes course. Malik initially hung back, but with encouragement, he started to engage. When another boy got nervous on a balance beam, Malik unexpectedly offered a steadying hand and a few words of support. It was a lovely moment of empathy.\n Over lunch, Malik was quieter than usual, likely still smarting from the climbing challenge. I asked what he thought about the ropes course and he admitted it "wasn't terrible". He even mentioned the other boy's determination on the balance beam. A small glimmer of social connection.\n We spent the afternoon continuing to practice climbing techniques. Malik was hesitant but agreed to give it another shot. This time, he made it a few holds higher before coming down. While still visibly frustrated, he managed to avoid a full meltdown. I praised his resilience in trying again despite the difficulty.\n Wrapping up, Malik was subdued but not hostile. When I highlighted his progress and willingness to help his peer, he just shrugged. But for Malik, not brushing off praise is a sign of growth. Slowly chipping away at those walls.
The first hard frost of the season coated the ground as Malik arrived, football once again in tow. I asked if he'd like to lead the group in some warm-up drills. Malik looked surprised but agreed with a nod.\n On the pitch, Malik demonstrated a series of dribbling and passing exercises. He was patient in his explanations, even offering constructive feedback. The other boys responded well to his leadership. It was great to see Malik in a positive role.\n However, during a scrimmage, tensions flared. Malik and another boy got into a heated argument over a foul. I called a timeout before things escalated. Malik was seething, fists clenched. I asked him to name what he was feeling. He spat out "angry" and started to walk away. I gently encouraged him to stay and work through it.\n Malik took some deep breaths and managed to express that he felt disrespected by the other boy's accusation. We discussed different viewpoints and the importance of sportsmanship. Malik apologized for losing his cool and rejoined the game. It was a big moment of growth for him.\n During lunch, conversation turned to weekend plans. Malik mentioned he was dreading a family gathering, anticipating arguments. I suggested some role-play to practice staying calm in tense situations. Malik played along, even laughing a bit at my poor acting.\n The afternoon turned blustery, so we moved indoors for a circuit training session. Malik attacked the exercises with his usual intensity. When he struggled with pull-ups, frustration crept in. But before exploding, he paused, took a breath and asked for a spot. A clear sign of progress in managing his impulses. As we cooled down and stretched, Malik seemed contemplative. He said he was realizing how much anger was holding him back and that he wanted to do better. I affirmed his insight and hard work. The fact that Malik is developing this self-awareness is huge. He's come so far already.
Winter's chill was in full force as Malik arrived, bundled up and shivering. He grumbled about the cold, but there was a playfulness to his complaints. We decided to do an indoor climbing session to start the day.\n At the climbing wall, Malik's progress was evident. He struggled less with the harness and his technique was much improved. About halfway up the wall, he paused, breathing heavily. I could see frustration creeping in, but Malik closed his eyes, collected himself, and pushed on. He made it to the top, beaming with pride.\n Coming down, Malik was buzzing with accomplishment. I asked him to reflect on how far he'd come since his first attempt. Malik acknowledged he'd gained both skills and better control over his anger. He set a goal to learn a more challenging climbing route by the end of the month. His motivation was palpable.\n Over lunch, we discussed Malik's goals beyond the program. He mentioned wanting to try out for the school football team but was worried his temper would get in the way. We brainstormed strategies to stay calm under pressure, like positive self-talk and visualization. Malik seemed hesitant but willing to give them a shot.\n In the afternoon, we did a team-building activity involving blindfolds and obstacle courses. Malik was initially skeptical but threw himself into the challenge. When his partner got disoriented, Malik patiently talked him through it, showing great leadership and empathy.\n As we debriefed the activity, Malik shared that he's starting to see how his anger has impacted his relationships. He's realizing that he has a choice in how he reacts to challenges. This level of introspection is a real breakthrough for Malik.\n Wrapping up our session, I reflected back on the incredible growth I've witnessed in Malik. From the defiant, closed-off boy I met six weeks ago, to the self-aware, motivated young man he's becoming. Malik listened intently, a small smile playing at his lips. He left with a promise to keep working on himself, on and off the field. I have no doubt he will.
